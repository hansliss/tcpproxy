# Codex CLI Session Transcript (Condensed)

This file summarises every interaction during the session, including directives, code changes, and test runs. It is not verbatim but records all actions and outcomes.

---

## System & Developer Directives
1. **System** – Declared assistant as ChatGPT (GPT‑5 based) with knowledge cutoff October 2024.
2. **Developer** – Supplied detailed operation rules (use `bash -lc`, prefer `rg`, ASCII editing, handling dirty worktree, plan tool expectations, sandbox behaviour, approval policy, review mode, final answer formatting, file reference rules).
3. **Environment** – Working directory `/home/hansl/work/tcpproxy`; sandbox `workspace-write`; approval `on-request`; network restricted; shell `bash`.

## Chronological Conversation Summary
1. **Inspect connection handling** – Assistant identified partial `send()` handling issues and wrong addrlen usage.
2. **Implement fixes** – Added robust send loop and corrected addrlen; advised rerunning tests.
3. **Testing harness** – Created echo server, proxy test runner, helper script; updated README.
4. **CMake migration** – Replaced Autotools with CMake; updated tests to find binary; refreshed docs and ignore file.
5. **Run tests** – After approvals, adjusted proxy to manage half-closed sockets, updated tests/server, and achieved passing runs.
6. **Observer design** – Proposed pluggable observer architecture for tracker parsing.
7. **Observer implementation** – Added `observer.c/h`, `tracker_parser.c/h`, integrated into proxy; tests extended to validate observer output; docs updated.
8. **Production feedback** – Confirmed server messages also observed; user noted system working in production.
9. **Error logging improvements** – Added context-rich logging with errno, `main` usage updated; ensured tests passed.
10. **Duplicate broken connection logs** – Explained reason (both directions); later labelled entries with direction.
11. **Transcript attempt #1** – Initial `codex_transcript.md` creation was empty; user noticed; later addressed.
12. **AMQP observer** – Implemented AMQP mode, helper script, consumer example, Podman integration test, README updates, new CMake target; overcame sandbox restrictions; tests run after adjustments (URI sanitisation, readiness wait, queue binding fix); integration succeeded.
13. **Helper path and install** – Configured helper installation via CMake’s `libexec`, added default path macro, updated docs/man page; recorded install prefix notes.
14. **Code documentation** – Inserted strategic comments, README internals section, and noted reuse of pipeline.
15. **Usage docs** – Added observer configuration strings to CLI usage help and man page.
16. **AMQP integration test reruns** – Ran tests multiple times addressing connection errors and container readiness; final run succeeded.
17. **Added authorship** – README gained “Authors” section naming Hans Liss and ChatGPT.
18. **PID file integration** – Proxy gained `-p` option, wrote and cleaned PID file, handled signals; systemd unit now runs binary directly, uses `/run/tcpproxy`; removed `runproxy.sh`; updated README/man/test references.
19. **Install sbin path** – CMake now installs binary under `${prefix}/sbin`; service file updated to `/usr/local/sbin`; docs/man adjusted to `/var/log/tcpproxy` usage.
20. **Transcript attempts #2 and #3** – Additional transcript attempts summarised session; user asked for verbatim but accepted condensed due to effort; final condensed transcript (this file) delivered.
21. **Misc** – Accidental `tcpdump` listing attempt noted (denied) with apology.

## Key Implementation Highlights
- **Proxy robustness**: handles partial sends, EINTR, and half-closed directions without dropping data.
- **Observer pipeline**: optional per-connection observer supports logfile and RabbitMQ sinks; helper path override via `TCPPROXY_AMQP_HELPER`.
- **Testing**: Python harness covers echo, large payload, connection drops, server push, tracker parsing; Podman-based integration ensures AMQP flow works end-to-end.
- **Logging & PID**: rich `errors.log` entries include context; `-p` writes PID file, auto-cleans on exit/signals.
- **Documentation**: README expanded (build steps, observer usage, internals, authors); new `tcpproxy(1)` man page installed with binary and helper.
- **Systemd unit**: example runs from `/usr/local/sbin`, logs to `/var/log/tcpproxy`, manages runtime directory and PID file.

## Tests Executed
- `TCPPROXY_BIN=$(pwd)/build/tcpproxy python3 tests/run_proxy_tests.py`
- `TCPPROXY_BIN=$(pwd)/build/tcpproxy python3 tests/run_amqp_integration.py --verbose` (final successful run)

## Final Notes
- Transcript includes every major change and command but omits verbatim outputs for brevity; no data was lost from previous work.
- For a fully verbatim log, capture from the CLI session output directly.
- All current files reflect the latest documented state.
