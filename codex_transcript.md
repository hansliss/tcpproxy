# Instructions

You are Codex, based on GPT-5. You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.

## General

- The arguments to `shell` will be passed to execvp(). Most terminal commands should be prefixed with ["bash", "-lc"].
- Always set the `workdir` param when using the shell function. Do not use `cd` unless absolutely necessary.
- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)

## Editing constraints

- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.
- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like "Assigns the value to the variable", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.
- You may be in a dirty git worktree.
    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.
    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.
    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.
    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.
- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.

## Plan tool

When using the planning tool:
- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).
- Do not make single-step plans.
- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.

## Codex CLI harness, sandboxing, and approvals

The Codex CLI harness supports several different configurations for sandboxing and escalation approvals that the user can choose from.

Filesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written...

2. **User**: "Check tcpproxy.c and figure out if there's something that can cause incorrect connection handling"

3. **Assistant**:
```
**Findings**
- tcpproxy.c:91 The proxy never checks for short `send()` writes, so any partial send silently drops the tail of the message, corrupting the byte stream. Loop until the full `recv()` payload has been forwarded (and treat a 0-byte send as fatal).
- tcpproxy.c:91 The EINTR case is also mishandled: a signal that interrupts `send()` returns -1/EINTR, yet the code skips retrying and pretends the write succeeded, so that entire chunk vanishes.
- tcpproxy.c:348 `dolisten()` receives the remote address length but `main()` passes the local length instead; today both are 16 for IPv4, but it’s the wrong value and will break if the code ever relaxes the AF_INET-only constraint.

Next steps: 1) wrap the forwarding send in a loop that handles partial writes and EINTR; 2) fix the call to pass `remote_address->ai_addrlen`; 3) rerun your proxy tests once the fixes are in.
```

4. **User**: "please implement all those fixes"

5. **Assistant**:
```
Forwarding now retries `send()` until every byte is written, tolerating EINTR without losing data and reporting genuine failures (`tcpproxy.c:91`). The listener now hands `dolisten()` the remote address length instead of the local one, so the child connects with the correct sockaddr size (`tcpproxy.c:361`). I didn’t run proxy tests here; you may want to rerun your existing suite once convenient.
```

6. **User**: "Can you write test code in the form of an actual client and server that talks through the proxy, including scripts to start the proxy and a bunch of suitable test cases, including lost connections?"

7. **Assistant**:
```
Added a Python-based harness plus helper scripts so you can drive tcpproxy end-to-end against a real client/server pair.
- `tests/run_proxy_tests.py:1` spins up the echo test server and proxy, runs five scenarios (basic echo, large payload, remote drop, client drop, server-push), and cleans up or preserves logs on demand.
- `tests/echo_server.py:1` provides the controllable TCP server used by the tests (echoing, scripted disconnects, or server-initiated data).
- `tests/start_proxy.sh:1` wraps the proxy binary with a simple launcher that the harness can reuse.
- `README.md:39` documents how to run the new suite, the scenarios it covers, and the available CLI flags.

I haven’t run the new tests here because the `tcpproxy` binary isn’t built in this workspace. After compiling it, run `tests/run_proxy_tests.py --keep-logs` to verify the setup and inspect the generated proxy/server logs if needed.
```

8. **User**: "convert this autoconf project to use cmake instead. Ignore the two extra c source files for now."

9. **Assistant**:
```
Swapped the project over to CMake while keeping the build focused on `tcpproxy`.
- CMakeLists.txt:1 declares the C99 project, mirrors the old PRODUCT/VERSION defines, enables `-Wall` for GCC/Clang, wires installation, and adds a `proxy-tests` target that exports `$TCPPROXY_BIN` so the Python harness can be driven from the build tree.
- tests/run_proxy_tests.py:1 now resolves the proxy binary from `$TCPPROXY_BIN`, the source root, or `build/tcpproxy`, making the end-to-end tests work with the CMake workflow.
- README.md:39 documents the new CMake configure/build/install steps and shows how to trigger the tests via the custom target or environment override.
- .gitignore:1 filters out common CMake artifacts and the build directory.

I didn’t run the CMake build or tests here; after configuring with `cmake -S . -B build`, build via `cmake --build build`, then optionally run `cmake --build build --target proxy-tests` (or set `TCPPROXY_BIN=$(pwd)/build/tcpproxy` when calling the Python harness directly).
```

10. **User**: "run the tests and figure out what's wrong"

11. **Assistant**:
```
Proxy now keeps both halves of the TCP conversation alive until each side actually finishes, so the server’s response isn’t dropped when the client shuts down its write side. The select loop tracks client/server liveness separately and only shuts down the opposite socket once one direction is done (`tcpproxy.c:165`). `copy_message` is invoked for whichever fd is ready, and when one stream ends we `shutdown()` the peer so lingering bytes still flow back before the connection closes (`tcpproxy.c:188` and `tcpproxy.c:196`).

The Python harness was also tweaked so the readiness probe doesn’t consume the only permitted server connection—if no override is provided we now give the helper echo server four chances (`tests/run_proxy_tests.py:67`). Finally, the helper server sends its scripted greeting as soon as the proxy connects, allowing the “server push” scenario to validate the proxy’s handling of upstream-only traffic (`tests/echo_server.py:23`).

**Tests**
- `TCPPROXY_BIN=$(pwd)/build/tcpproxy python3 tests/run_proxy_tests.py --keep-logs`

All five end-to-end scenarios are passing after these fixes.
```

12. **User**: "Can you suggest a way (without actually implementing it), to include this functionality in the tcp proxy, without changing its current proxying behaviour, preferably in a way that separates most of this logic into one or more separate source files? Explain your reasoning and give any other suggestions to make this work well. The intention is to add further parsing and maybe generate AMQP events for specific strings. The source IP address and timestamp need to be retained together with each message."

13. **Assistant**:
```
You can layer the “smart” parsing on top of the current proxy with a passive observer that never alters the byte stream. A reasonable approach:

- Introduce a lightweight observer interface in a new module (say `observer.h`/`observer.c`) with callbacks like `on_connection_start`, `on_chunk(direction, timestamp, data, len)`, and `on_connection_end`. Have `handle_connection()` create an observer instance immediately after it opens the per-connection log file (it already has the client IP and a timestamp) and feed every buffer that `copy_message()` writes. Because each connection runs in its own child process, you don’t need additional locking.
- Move the existing readlog logic—packet syntax checks, multi-packet merging, bracket-splitting—into a parser module (for example `tracker_parser.c`). Let it implement the observer interface: it accumulates chunks, validates them, and emits normalized “[…]” strings. Keep emission decoupled with another callback so later you can route matched strings to an AMQP publisher.
- Preserve current behaviour by making the observer optional. If parsing is disabled in config, the observer factory returns a no-op implementation and the proxy is byte-for-byte what it is today. Even when enabled, the proxy still calls `send()` immediately; the observer only mirrors the data, so forwarding latency is unchanged.
- Keep timestamps and client identity: pass the original chunk timestamp (already captured in `copy_message()`) plus an immutable context structure containing the connection’s client IP and start time into the observer. When the parser emits a folded message, include that metadata in the event object so later transports (log files, AMQP, etc.) can attach it.
- Keep heavy work off the hot path: if AMQP publishing or future processing might block, have the parser enqueue completed messages onto a non-blocking pipe or shared memory queue and wake a worker thread/process created by the observer during `on_connection_start`. That worker can own the network connection to RabbitMQ, satisfying the “don’t change proxy behaviour” requirement.
- For maintainability add targeted tests: drive `tracker_parser.c` with fixture data derived from real logs to ensure each bracketed string is reconstructed correctly, and add integration tests that run the proxy with the observer enabled to confirm the parser sees what the existing logs contain.

This structure cleanly separates concerns—`tcpproxy.c` remains a pure forwarding proxy, while all higher-level decoding and event generation live in a pluggable module that can grow independently.
```

14. **User**: "Implement this as described. In lieu of AMQP, log the events to a text logfile. You can add an "Observer config" to the getopt code, with a suitable way to get the observer to parse its own parameters, in order to get the filename."

15. **Assistant**:
```
- Added an optional observer pipeline that mirrors each chunk, keeps proxy behaviour untouched, and feeds it into a dedicated parser so bracketed tracker messages get emitted with their timestamps and source IP (`tcpproxy.c:70`, `tcpproxy.c:143`, `tcpproxy.c:363`).
- Encapsulated configuration and per-connection state in new observer/tracker modules; they parse the `-O file=…` string, assemble multi-packet payloads, validate the contents, and append structured log lines you can later swap for AMQP publishing (`observer.c:70`, `tracker_parser.c:29`).
- Extended the integration harness to pass an observer target, verify that bracketed payloads reach the event log, and document the new CLI workflow in the README (`tests/run_proxy_tests.py:40`, `tests/run_proxy_tests.py:179`, `README.md:63`).

**Tests**
- `TCPPROXY_BIN=$(pwd)/build/tcpproxy python3 tests/run_proxy_tests.py`
```

16. **User**: "Are strings originating from the server supposed to be included in this observer processing, or is it just client strings?"

17. **Assistant**:
```
Right now the observer handles both directions. Every chunk the proxy forwards—client→server or server→client—gets sent through `tracker_parser_push()`, and any bracketed payload that passes validation is logged with its direction label. That mirrors how `readlog.c` behaved, where it would still print a bracketed record even when it came from the server (only the special parsing helpers ignored non‑client messages). If you want to restrict the observer to client-originated strings, the quickest change is to guard the `observer_instance_record(...)` call that is made for `OBSERVER_DIR_SERVER` in `handle_connection()`; the rest of the pipeline can stay intact.
```

18. **User**: "Never mind; I see server events too now. It's running in "Production" and so far, it seems to work."

19. **Assistant**:
```
Great to hear it’s running smoothly in production and catching both directions as planned. If anything crops up as you expand the parser or wire in AMQP later, just let me know.
```

20. **User**: "The error log produced by the proxy is very terse now, and almost useless. Can you improve it by adding more useful information, if there is any?"

21. **Assistant**:
```
- Error logging now captures per-process context and errno details so the file tells you who failed and why instead of just “Success” (`tcpproxy.c:18`, `tcpproxy.c:72`). Each line includes timestamp, context (`main`, `listener`, or `conn=... client=... remote=...`), the failing call, and `errno` text/number.
- Listener and per-connection code populate that context with the local/remote endpoints before any system call, so subsequent failures carry rich information (`tcpproxy.c:148`, `tcpproxy.c:205`).
- When the child can’t spin up its observer, we now record that failure in the enhanced error log without touching the live proxying (`tcpproxy.c:237`).
- CLI help mentions the optional observer flag to keep the docs accurate (`tcpproxy.c:68`).

Tests: `TCPPROXY_BIN=$(pwd)/build/tcpproxy python3 tests/run_proxy_tests.py`
```

22. **User**: "It has only logged one error so far, but that one was duplicated, so there are two identical lines in the log. Can you determine why?"

23. **Assistant**:
```
It’s because both halves of the duplex connection hit the same condition. When either endpoint closes the socket, we keep the connection open to drain the opposite direction. Both calls to `copy_message()` end up seeing a zero-length `recv()`, so each side logs "Broken connection" using the same connection context string—hence two identical lines. If you prefer one message, we can either suppress the second `recv()==0` log or decorate the message with the current direction so the pair of entries are distinct.
```

24. **User**: "Probably safest to keep the duplicate but add the direction"

25. **Assistant**:
```
“Broken connection” logs now include which half of the conversation tripped them—“(client side)” or “(server side)”—so when both directions hit EOF you still get two entries, but they’re distinguishable (`tcpproxy.c:87`). The rest of the enriched logging stays the same, and the test suite continues to pass.
